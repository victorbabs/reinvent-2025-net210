# NET210 | Network observability in AWS: Picking the right tool for the job

### Session Abstract

AWS offers a rich network observability toolbox, including Amazon CloudWatch Network Synthetic Monitor, Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor, Amazon VPC Reachability Analyzer, Amazon VPC Flow Logs and the latest Amazon CloudWatch Network Flow Monitor. Yet, many teams struggle to know which tool to grab when latency spikes, packets vanish, or hybrid links fluctuate. In this interactive chalk talk, AWS networking specialists map the most common real-world scenarios to the most effective observability service, explaining when, where, why, and how to use each tool for the right job.
